- Extracting content from PDF resumes and a job description (JD)
- Structuring both CV and JD data into a consistent JSON format
- Using GPT to evaluate each candidate across 7 key dimensions
- Returning both **scores (0‚Äì10)** and **human-readable explanations**
- Exporting results to an Excel file for easy review and analysis
